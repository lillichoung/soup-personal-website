## PhD Student, Carnegie Mellon University
Hi! I'm a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu). I am lucky to be advised by Phil Gibbons in Parallel Data Lab, and I work on compiler and operating system optimizations for heterogeneous systems. Outside of research, I enjoy drawing, photography, cooking, and coffee. I also occasionally dabble in computer security.
